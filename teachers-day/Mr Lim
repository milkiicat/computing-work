My first impresion of Mr Lim is that he is very friendly. He is very positive and always tells us to look at the bright side no matter what. 
He also makes his lessons interesting to keep the class engaged. He also is very knowedgeable. He teaches us many values that will help us be a better person.
The class' wellbeing is his priority, which makes it resectable. He always encourages us to do our best, and also is very open to students who ask him for help. 
He will always be there when you need to talk to him, no matter whether it is about academics or our personal lives. He teaches us things that will help in our daily 
lives even after leaving school, like deep breathing exercises to help calm ourselves when we are anxious. He is always very composed and never gets angry even when students
are talking, but instead reminds them nicely. Lastly, his positive attitude is most commendable. Whenever we are tired or just dont feel like doing work, he senses that and 
changes his lessons to be more interesting along the way by telling stories that we can relate to and use to learn the chapter better, as well as encourages us by asking us to 
look further, and that if we work hard now, we will have an easier time when it comes to exams. 
Mr Lim also takes out his time to help and start extra classes and consultations to make sure the weaker students will not be lacking behind and to be promoted as a class 
together, instilling class spirit and allowing the students to feel more at ease with his help. "
